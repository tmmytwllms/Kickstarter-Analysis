# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    An analysis was completed of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter campaigns. This analysis looked at the outcomes of 1,369 Kickstarter campaigns for theater based on their
    outcomes which were either successful, failed, or canceled. The analysis then looked at the outcomes of all theater campaigns based on their start date and play campaigns
    based on their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    First, an analysis of the outcomes Kickstarter campaigns for theater based on launch date was completed. Similarly to the previous analysis conducted on theater and play campaigns,
    May had the highest number of launched campaigns at 166, and also the highest number of successful campaigns at 111 and highest number of failed campaigns at 52. The number
    of successful campaigns continue to decline until August, whereas the failed campaigns were roughly 50 from May to August. The highest number of canceled campaigns was 7 for
    campaigns that began in January, which declined to about 3 for the remainder of the year, with no canceled campaigns being started in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Lastly, an analysis of the outcomes of play campaigns based on their funding goals was conducted. The highest percentage of successful plays and lowest number of failed plays,
    76% and 24% respectively, occurred for campaigns with funding goals less than $1000 USD. Campaigns with funding goals between $1000 and $5000 USD had the second highest percentage
    of successful campaigns and lowest number of failed campaigns with a success rate of 73% and failed rate of 27%. Play campaigns with funding goals between $45,000 and $50,000
    USD had the highest number of failed campaigns and lowest number of successful campaigns, with failed campaigns making up 100% of this campaign goal range. There were no 
    canceled campaigns for plays in this data set.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The main challenge of working with this data set was creating a pivot table to list the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns based on their month
    of launch. This challenge was overcome by filtering the data set on the theater parent category field and years field, by adding them to the filters for the pivot table.
    Then, the data had to had to be organized by months using out Date Created Conversion field on the rows section of the table, and then removing the additional date fields
    to display only the months of the year.

## Results
   Based on the analysis of the outcomes based on launch date data set, I can conclude that May is the best time for Louise to launch her play campaign because the highest number
   of successful campaigns begin in may. I can also conclude that while successful campaigns occur much less in October than in May, that there is little chance she will have to
   cancel her campaign because the data indicated that no canceled theater campaigns began in October.

   Based on the analysis of the ouctomes based on goals data set, I can conclude that Louise's campaign goal should be less than $5000 USD, as campaigns with goals less than $1000 USD
   and goals between $1000 and $5000 USD have the highest percentage of success and lowest percentage of failure. I can also conclude that a campaign goal of $45,000 USD or more
   would likely be unsuccessful.

   This data set has several limitations. For the outcomes based on launch data set, we do not know what the average campaign goals are for each month of the year. Secondly, 
   for the outcomes based on goals data set, we do not have any data regarding how many campaigns were canceled, or what their goals were. Lastly, the data set did not contain 
   a total run time for campaigns, which may affect their degree of success, failure, or cancellation.

   This data set would benefit from additional tables and graphs. Firstly, a table and graph displaying the outcomes percentages based on campaign length would be helpful in
   determining how long successful, failed, and canceled campaigns run for. Lastly, a table and graph displaying the campaign length based on campaign goals would be helpful in
   determining how long the successful, failed, and canceled campaigns ran for before reaching their outcome.
