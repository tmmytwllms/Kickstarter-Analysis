# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis of 4,113 Kickstarter campaigns was completed to determine the number of campaign outcomes which were: successful, failed, cancelled, and live campaigns.

First, this analysis contained a breakdown of campaign outcomes by parent category. This analysis revealed that Kickstarter campaigns in the "Theater" parent category were the most common and most successful, and also had the most failed campaigns.

Second, an analysis of campaign outcomes by sub-category was completed. This analysis revealed that campaigns in the "Plays" sub-category vastly outnumber all other sub-categories, and were the most successful.

An analysis of 5 Kickstarter campaigns for "Plays," for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival was also completed. This analysis revealed that all 5 plays met or exceeded their campaign goals and were successful. 
---
An analysis of successful and failed campaigns for the "Plays" subcategory in the United States was also completed. The data indicates that plays with an average goal of about $5000 USD were successful, whereas plays with an average goal of about $10,500 failed. The mean was lower than the standard deviation of goals and pledged sets of data for the successful campaigns, indicating that the data below the mean is closer to the center. The upper quartile and mean for goals and pledged data sets for successful campaigns indicates that both sets of data have a similar distribution. For the unsuccessful campaigns, the mean was much lower than the standard deviation for the goals and pledged data sets, which indicates there are some outliers that drive the data. Additionally, the upper quartile of the goals and pledged data sets was close to the mean, indicating both sets of data had a similar distribution.

Lastly, an analysis of of campaigns for the "Musical" sub-category in Great Britain was completed. This data indicated that most campaigns for the "Musical" subcategory had goals amount between $1000 and $5000 USD, with a mean of $4000. Most of the campaigns in this subcategory had a pledged amount between $0 and $1500 USD, with a mean of $1000 USD. This anlysis revealed that on average, Kickstarter campaigns in Great Britain within the "Musical" subcategory had an average pledged amount 4 times lower than the average goal amount.

I reccommend that Louise launch her initial play campaign with a goal of $5,000 USD in the US in May, which is the best time of the year to start a successful campaign based on the Kickstarter data that was analyzed. The "theater" and "plays" parent category and sub-category, respectively, were the most common and successful campaigns. Sucessfull campaigns for "Plays" in the US had an average goal of $5000 USD, and it is reccommended she lower her budget to meet this goal successfully. Failed campaigns for "Plays" in the US had an average goal of $10,000 USD, which is Louise's goal, which is not likely to be met. Additionally, I reccomend that Louise lower her budget for her musical to $1000 USD, as the $4000 USD budget is four times higher than the average pledged goal for musical campaigns in Great Britain.
